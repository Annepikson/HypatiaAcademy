**What is Python**


1.  Can you make a web page with Python?  

yes.  You can use the Django framework.  Normally you would use JavaScript and HTML and CSS to make a web page.

Most programmers do not use Python for front-end programming.  Front-end programming means web pages.  or mobile phone apps.

To create web pages you do not write HTML and CSS.  That would be very SLOOOOOOOW

JavaScript with React framework
Java with Struts
JavaScript with Express/Angular/Vue

Before you learn any framework you have to learn the language.

One of the frameworks we will learn in PyGame, to make games.  But people who write games don't Python, because it's easier in other languages.  Like on iPad there in Object-C.  Androind that Kotlin.

2.  What do you use Python for?

* machine learning
* reading files
* using APIs
* read and write to databases
* read JSON/CSV files


You can say that Python is **middleware**.  There are basically two types of programming: (1) middleware and (2) front end
