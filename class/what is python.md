**What is Python?  When do you use Python**


1.  Can you make a web page with Python?  

Yes.  You can use the Django framework.  But in general Python is not a graphics or web page language.  Normally you would use JavaScript and HTML and CSS to make a web page. And, as we are teaching, you can make gaming graphics using the PyGame Python package.

Most programmers do not use Python for front-end programming.  Front-end programming means web pages or mobile phone apps.  Front-end is anything with a screen or button.  It takes a completely different set of skills to do front-end programming than backend (also known as middleware).  In general the front-end is simpler, since all the business logic is in the back-end.  But the front-end frameworks and API are generally difficult to learn.  

To create web pages you do not write HTML and CSS.  That would be very SLOOOOOOOW as you have to write all these long takes like <table>.  What programmers do instead is to use code to modify what is called the **dom** (Document object model).  Here are some frameworks:

* JavaScript with React framework
* Java with Struts
* JavaScript with Express/Angular/Vue

Before you learn any framework you have to learn the language that uses it, like JavaScript.

As for mobile devices, on Apple (iOS) there is Object-C and a few more.  Android has Kotlin, Java, and a few more.

2.  What do you use Python for?

* machine learning
* reading files
* using APIs
* read and write to databases
* read JSON/CSV files
* it's built into popular big data, noSQL databases like Apache Spark
* using APIs you use it to work with Apache Hadoop and other distributed systems


You can say that Python is **middleware**.  There are basically two types of programming: (1) middleware and (2) frontend.
