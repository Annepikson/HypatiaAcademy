# Bash Shell Commands

A **shell** means the window where you type commands on a UNIX system.  Bash is the most common one and the easiest to use.  

Both Ubuntu and Mac are based on UNIX.  Windows is not.  It's command shell is called DOS.  You get to that by running the `cmd` commmand on Windows.

The terminal on Ubuntu and Mac is a bash shell.  On Winows it is DOS.  In order to have a UNIX environment on Windows install cygwin.

On MAC you might have to run this command to change from the default shell to the Bash shell:

`chsh -s /bin/bash`

## copy file

means copy file a.txt to b.txt

`cp a.txt b.txt`
