    "Classes and objects is usually an advanced topic.  But we present it early because in the student product inventory project we need to create customer and sales order data.  As you will see if is far easier to do this using objects that using dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a diagram from our student project to create an inventory system.  As you can see a customer object has a variable number of sales orders.  Think of when you (the customer) go to the store and buy something (the orders).  In a SQL database you would create those as separate object.  But in a JSON database you would put them together.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do both.  First we will store the data in a MongoDB (JSON) database.  Then we will store them in a PostgreSQL SQL database.  But that is the last step.  First we have to learn how to create the objects and write them to a file.\n",
